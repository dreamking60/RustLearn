# Rust Learn
Learning coding by Rust.

## Chapter1
./hello_cargo
./hello_world
### Compile and Execute
```sh
#compile
rustc main.rs
#execute
./main
```

### Build project by cargo
```sh
#init project
cargo new [project name]
#build project for debug
cargo build
#run the project
cargo run
#check the project's executable file
cargo check
# build for release
cargo build --release
```

## Chapter2
./guessing_game
Use Cargo.toml file to manage rust project

## Chapter3
### varables and Mutability
By default varaiables are immutable.  
Use `mut` to make variables mutable.  
Constant value use `const` to define.
```Rust
    //immutable
    let x = 5; 
    //mutable
    let mut y = 5;
    //constant
    const z = 5;
```
Declare a new variable with the same name sa a previous variable, then the first variable is shadowed by the second.
```Rust
    let x = 5;
    let x = x+1;
    
    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
```

Shadowing is different from marking a variable as mut, because weâ€™ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the let keyword. By using let, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

### Data Types
Basic Type: Integer, float, boolean and char.  

Compund Type: tuple and array.
```Rust
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1)
```
